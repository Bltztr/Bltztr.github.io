Welcome to my blog!

I'm **Sergio Motrel**, a computer engineering student at University of Valladolid.

A few years ago I was working in a well-known company in something completely different, but I decided to quit and pursue my childhood dream. Today I have found my passion but I have a lot of work ahead of me.
I'm interested in the world of cybersecurity, especially in pentesting and ethical hacking and I love solving online CTF rooms and learning a bit more everyday.

My intention is to write all my learning path in this subject. Maybe someone will find it useful, I will focus mainly on writeups of ctf rooms and my study on hacking.

Who knows, one day I might look at this and remember when I was dreaming about being a computer scientist as a kid.

See you around and have fun!
